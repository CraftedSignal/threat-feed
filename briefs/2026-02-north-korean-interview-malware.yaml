    ## Overview

    In 2025, GitLab Threat Intelligence discovered a North Korean APT group employing sophisticated social engineering tactics to deliver a custom malware variant named 'Interview'. This operation involved posing as legitimate IT professionals seeking employment at various organizations. The attackers submitted resumes and engaged in interview processes, using this as an opportunity to infiltrate target networks. The primary goal was to establish a persistent presence within the victim's infrastructure, potentially for data exfiltration or espionage. Defenders should be aware of the potential for malicious actors to exploit the hiring process.

    ## Attack Chain

    1. The attacker creates a fake IT professional profile and crafts a convincing resume.
    2. The attacker applies for IT positions within target organizations, focusing on roles with broad network access.
    3. During the interview process, the attacker may be asked to complete a take-home coding assignment or participate in a remote technical interview.
    4. The attacker delivers a seemingly benign file (e.g., a script or document) that contains an embedded malicious payload disguised as a resume file.
    5. Upon execution, the malicious payload drops and executes the 'Interview' malware.
    6. 'Interview' establishes persistence on the compromised system.
    7. The malware establishes command and control (C2) communication with the attacker's infrastructure.
    8. The attacker performs reconnaissance on the network, identifies valuable data, and potentially exfiltrates sensitive information.

    ## Impact

    Successful compromise allows the North Korean APT to gain a foothold within the targeted organization's network. This can lead to the exfiltration of sensitive data, intellectual property theft, and potential disruption of critical services. While the exact number of victims is unknown, the potential scope includes any organization actively hiring IT personnel. The financial and reputational damage could be significant, especially for organizations in sensitive sectors.
