    ## Overview

    The threat lies in the ability to automate the creation and deployment of CrowdStrike Fusion workflows using the open-source "security-skills" toolset developed by eth0izzle. This toolset integrates with Claude Code or any SKILLS.md compatible editor, enabling users to define and deploy complex workflows in YAML format. The tool leverages the CrowdStrike API to fetch tenant-specific configurations, integrations, and actions, reducing the complexity of workflow creation. By simplifying and automating playbook deployment, this development lowers the barrier to entry for adversaries seeking to rapidly implement malicious security automation within compromised CrowdStrike environments. The initial release was announced on Reddit on February 20, 2026, and is available on GitHub.

    ## Attack Chain

    1.  Attacker gains access to a CrowdStrike tenant (via compromised credentials or other means).
    2.  Attacker installs the `security-skills` plugin into their Claude Code environment using the command `/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/eth0izzle/security-skills.git`.
    3.  The attacker installs the fusion-workflows skill using the command `/plugin install fusion-workflows@security-skills`.
    4.  Attacker authenticates the plugin to the CrowdStrike API using stolen credentials.
    5.  Attacker crafts a malicious workflow definition in YAML, potentially targeting sensitive data or systems.
    6.  The attacker uses Claude Code to test the workflow against their CrowdStrike tenant.
    7.  The attacker deploys the malicious workflow into the CrowdStrike environment using Claude Code, fully automating a malicious playbook.
    8. The workflow executes on schedule, performing unauthorized actions or exfiltrating data.

    ## Impact

    Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, system compromise, and the disruption of security operations. By automating malicious playbooks, attackers can significantly amplify the impact of their attacks and evade detection. If the CrowdStrike tenant is used across an enterprise, the attacker could pivot between systems and potentially access hundreds of machines.
